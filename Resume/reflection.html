  <h1>Resume Project Reflection</h1>
  <h2>By Christian Sainz</h2>
  <p>We were tasked to take the code and methods from class to make our own version of resume site prototype. Thomas also encouraged us to make it our own and dress it up however we wanted.</p>
  
  <p>For mine I didn’t really change anything in functionality. I did want to add real nice color scheme to really make it stand out. I changed the back ground to this dark blue and pair it with this bright aqua green for the navigation tabs and footer. To add some visual hierarchy, I change the “related links” buttons to thirsted violent as well as made that the color for the links on the page. </p>
  
  <p>I didn’t just want the buttons to turn black when the user’s cursor hovered over them. I change the main navigation buttons fade to a lighter shade of blue than the site’s background. For the related links I had them fade to purple. I also change the tradition speed from “0.5s” to a slightly slower “0.7s” have it be a little bit smoother. </p>
  
  <p>I big problem I had to work through was editing the media queries of the CSS to make it responsive with most mobile devices. Using the base code that Thomas demonstrated in class worked great for when I shrunk the browser window down, but when I pulled up the site on my phone it was off-center really bad. I spend quite a few hours messing with the code until it looked correct through all of the views in Google Chrome’s developer tools. The site looks great now in all of the phone and tablet views Chrome has in its view library except for one. For the “Galaxy Fold” view its off-center and the footer is smooshed up, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Galaxy Fold used. </p>
  
  <p>I think if I was to add or change anything I might try to link this resume to my illustration portfolio that I’ll be making for the final project. I would probably make the skills in the resume clickable so it will take the users to a page that showcase examples of me using the respective skills. </p>
